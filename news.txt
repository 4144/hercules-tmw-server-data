##3 Has Magic Returned?
##3 2009-05-31
 
##0 A string of curious incidents have left Hurnscald
##0 citizens baffled, and raised questions about
##0 whether magic might have made a come-back in
##0 our peaceful province.
 
##0 Tulimshar healer Elanore reports that a small
##0 group of novice healers have sought to become
##0 her apprentices-- for the first time in years.
##0 Farmer Hinnak, tells us of a mysterious woman
##0 who reportedly bewitched his garden. Also,
##0 someone seems to have moved into the
##0 abandoned hut west of Hurnscald-- repairing it
##0 over night! Can there be any natural explanation
##0 for these events? We do ask our readers to keep
##0 their eyes open!

##3 Central Tulimshar
##3 2009-02-11
 
##0 Central Tulimshar is now open again. Work
##0 continues on the rest of the city.
 
##3 Rebalancing
##3 2009-01-19
 
##0 The rebalancing done on enigma (our official
##0 test server) is now on our main server. Work is
##0 being done on getting the next testing period
##0 ready. All monsters have been rebalanced and
##0 the desert especially has different monster
##0 positions. Monster exp has been reworked as
##0 well.
 
##0 The cotton boots are finally available in
##0 certain shops. Also, as most of you have already
##0 seen, hair styles have been reorganized so both
##0 genders can use all styles. Note that only 0.0.27
##0 can see them all. Older clients will only see the
##0 male styles. New hair colors are in the works as
##0 well.
 
##3 Open Testing on Official Test Server
##3 2009-01-04 through 2009-01-11
 
##0 A testing period on enigma (our official test
##0 server) has started. Experience and drop rates
##0 are 10 times higher than normal during this
##0 period. We're testing new monster placement, new
##0 monster stats, and our new experience formula.
##0 Use of 0.0.27 for this is encouraged, though all
##0 currently supported clients are welcome. Please
##0 direct all feedback to the appropriate thread on
##0 the forums.
 
##0 To participate in this testing, set your server
##0 to enigma.dy.fi. Enigma shouldn't be used between
##0 open test periods, as the content may be in an
##0 unusable state. Characters and accounts may be
##0 wiped at any time between testing periods.
 
##3 Monster Mutations and Experience Point Changes
##3 2008-12-10
 
##0 We have rebalanced monster experience points
##0 and added two new mechanisms to make the
##0 game more challenging:  monster mutations, by
##0 which monster attributes (and experience points)
##0 are slightly modified for each individual
##0 monster, and increased boni for shared kills:
##0 killing a monster with a group of fighters now
##0 yields significantly more experience points than
##0 killing it alone. To adjust for the latter
##0 increase, we have reduced base experience points
##0 for low and medium-level monsters, though we
##0 expect levelling to be easier overall.

##3 Mines and weddings!
##3 2008-10-11
 
##0 A new mining operation has started north of
##0 town. The company's director has stated that
##0 the mine's output has been sufficient and no
##0 problems have been encountered.
 
##0 A new wedding officiator has been
##0 commissioned. She has set up shop west of
##0 town. Many couples are rejoicing that a new
##0 officiator is in the region.

##3 Volcano erupted!
##3 14/09/2008
 
##0 A volcano has erupted east of the city, causing
##0 major damage. Repairs are under way. The guard
##0 has cautioned that the new beach area that was
##0 opened up by the rumbling should be explored
##0 with caution.
 
##0 In related news, local alchemists have stated
##0 that the ash from the eruption is what caused
##0 many items of clothing to be bleached.

##3 Strange stones appeared and pass cleared
##3 15/04/2008
 
##0 Strange stones appeared in towns all over The
##0 Mana World. No one knows how they appeared
##0 and what they are good for. Can you solve their
##0 riddle?
 
##0 In other news: The pass to the southeast of the
##0 desert has been cleared and a mountain area
##0 with a lot of snakes has been discovered behind
##0 it. Rumors say that an eremite lives in that
##0 area who is a genius at leatherworks.

##3 Fast attack bug fixed, gameplay changes
##3 07/04/2008
 
##0 This weekend a fix was applied for the bug that
##0 allowed you to attack with light-speed with
##0 several weapons. We understand this changes
##0 gameplay quite a bit, and as a result the game
##0 will probably need to be adjusted. The existence
##0 of this bug has effectively prevented us from
##0 ever being able to balance the gameplay
##0 properly.
 
##0 Please stay with us and allow us some time to
##0 make the necessary adjustments. Suggestions are
##0 welcome!

##3 Soulless characters deleted and money cut
##3 21/01/2007
 
##0 A long time ago we have allowed characteres to
##0 sell their soul in order to gain additional
##0 powers. They were explicitly warned that they
##0 would be eventually deleted. This time has now
##0 come.

##0 anybody who had more than 10.000 GP.
