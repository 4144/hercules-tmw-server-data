They are coming from nowhere and you can't escape while they are still alive. Watch out because if you take too much time, you will die due to the smell of the caves. You will try to come out of the aceve, crawling and whe you'll be outside, the normal air will kill you. So you better be quick.\"";

Don't worry, you'll have time to look in each chest of each caves. Why chests? Well because you have a hidden cave which is locked by several lockets on an invisible door. I don't exactly know the number of lockets but that might turn around 10.\"";

That is why the fey element is waiting for another fresh changling, stronger than the previous one. As you can see, scary story.\"";

I would personally take some water, I'm always thirsty. Don't be afraid to take too much of each, the battles take time to end.\"";
