They come from nowhere and you can't escape while they are still alive. And if you take too much time, you will die due to the foul air in the caves and the monsters will move your body outside, to the entrance of the cave. So you better be quick.\"";

They are inside some chests. The problem is, once you try to open the chest, the monsters I told you about will surround you.\"";
  next;
  mes "\"In these caves, either you die, or they die. This is the only rule. When you kill all the monsters in a cave, make sure you get out immediatelly, because of the air. Don't worry, They only appear when you open the chests.\"";

And his offspring usually forgets about its own origin, growing up in a human family. But they are usually 'people' with really bad temper, the kind of people who does terrible things in this world...\"";

  mes "\"Oh, and if you really plan to rescue the girl in the cave, I advise you to use potions for every single battle, I'm thinking of Concentration and Iron Potions. You might want to take some food with you, you might be hungry in battle. I would personally take some water, I'm always thirsty. Don't be afraid to take too much of each, the battles take time to end.\"";
