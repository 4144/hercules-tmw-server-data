Dependencies:

    * ant (recent version)
    * J2SE 5 or higher (or equivalent)
    * Tiled or Tiled core jar file (in this directory)
    * TMW Tiled plugin jar (in this directory or the plugins directory)

Compilation:

    Run ant from this directory.

Usage:

    * Create a directory called tmwdata containing the client data
      (can be symlink)

    * Output will be in a directory called server-data
      (usually you make this a symlink to eathena-data)

    * If the aforementioned jar files are in class path you can run the
      converter jar file directly:

        java -jar converter.jar

      Otherwise, the Converter class can handle that for you:

        java Converter
