// Option to force a player to create an e-mail.
// If a player have default e-mail, and if you activate this option, the player can only connect in the game (to arrive on a map) like follow:
// - Create at least 1 character
// - Select 1 character
// - Select DEL to enter his/her e-mail. (if OK is choosen, client says to the player: 'invalid e-mail')
// - If his/her e-mail is correct, the player enter in the game (an e-mail is saved definitively).
// - If his/her e-mail is incorrect, he/she have 'incorrect e-mail' and must select again DEL.
// - After entering in the game (when the player arrives on a map), DEL and SEL/OK button work normaly for all next connections.
// Resume: If a player have "incorrect/invalid e-mail" when he/she click on 'OK' button,
//         the player must click 'DEL' button and register his/her NEW e-mail to enter in the game
// So, default is 0, because administrator must explain to their players before to activate this option.
