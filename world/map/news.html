This weekend we're temporarily doubling both the
experience rate and the drop rates for all monsters,
to give the chance to recover from the rollback
we had due to filesystem corruption.
<p/>
There are also some bug fixes and new content:
<p/>
The craftsmen of Tulimshar have finally moved to the
renovated Forge at the Northern Market, so the
Wizard's Inn is back to offering a calm stay for visitors.
<p/>
In the woodland area the mysterious Evil Obelisk which
summons beings from the astral plane for the mundane
price of gold has drastically reduced its demands.
<p/>
On the technical side, in case of network congestion,
you will no longer be kicked with an invalid packet error.

We're having a bugfix release today.
<p/>
The main areas that have been fixed are Brodomir's PvP Cave
and Orum's quest, both in the
caves below Hurnscald.
<p/>
Additionally, there were a lot of small fixes
on maps, spelling and grammar, and more.
<p/>
We'd like to thank all the people who reported issues and helped
testing!

Today we have a content release.
<p/>
As always there are a number of bugfixes,
but also two new quests.
<p/>
One of them is an annual Easter event created by Pjotr Orial.
It lasts from March, 22th to April, 25th, and can be
repeated every year.
Watch out around Hurnscald for some hidden Easter Eggs!
<p/>
The other quest is about the admiration of a little
girl in Hurnscald that sees you growing from an
inexperienced adventurer to an impressive hero.
Backstage, this was also about a great community effort.
veryape conceived of the idea for this quest and was able
to make it happen with the help of many people who were
assisting with the graphics, scripting, spell checking,
testing and giving valuable feedback.
<p/>
Lastly, Brodomir's cave under Hurnscald has been made
easier for attracting fighters from all over the world.

After the initial server move, The Mana World was subjected
to a three day DoS attack.
In response, we have moved a final time to a server that has
better protection against such attacks.
All game related services have been moved and are back to normal.

As of this Saturday, March 9, TMW moved to a new host.
This means there was some downtime, starting at 16:00 UTC.
<p/>
Most work was done in 1.5 hours, with a brief shutdown later.
DNS settings may take a while to propogate.

Among code cleaning and bug fixes, the
Tulimshar quests can be done in any order now.
Their completion isn't necessary anymore
to start the Bandit quest.
<p/>
Also, GMs may have a surprise for you someday.

This is a really exciting news entry!
<p/>
Congratulations to our sister project Mana (<a href="http://manasource.org">http://manasource.org</a>)
on winning the Liberated Pixel Cup (<a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/content/code-judging-is-in">http://lpc.opengameart.org/content/code-judging-is-in</a>).
<p/>
The project can be found at <a href="http://www.sourceoftales.org/news.html">http://www.sourceoftales.org/news.html</a>

<p/>
We will undoubtedly experience an influx of both
ordinary players and potential developers since we
were linked as a related project.
<p/>
As a developer, it is my goal and expectation that
new players can figure things out on their own.
After all, I once did - though there wasn't as
much content back then (I feel old ...).
<p/>
As for new contributors, they will necessarily need
to coordinary with us, the developers. We're always
in need of pixel artists, have great capacity for
quest writers, and currently have need for a bit of
web development and people crazy enough to touch
insides of the server code.
<p/>
Be aware that people have different time zones and
busy schedules, so it may be a while before anyone
responds.

ManaPlus Support
<p/>
We have decided to support ManaPlus as an
official client alongside Mana. In fact, since
there will likely be no more releases of the
Mana client that supports TMWA (this server),
there will inevitably be a time when ManaPlus
becomes the only supported client.
<p/>
Mana 0.6.1 will continue to receive some
support until October 2013. We have no plans
to specifically break compatibility with Mana,
but new features may not be available.
<p/>
For older clients (whether Mana or ManaPlus),
there will be different levels of attempted
support, depending on exactly how old it is:
<p/>
* Less than 6 months old: will not crash or
    behave erratically.
* Less than 2 months old: will behave
    expectedly, but might not support all features.
* Last 2 releases: will do everything,
    correctly, on the main server.
* Last release, or even git, may be required
    on the test server.
<p/>
Of course, if a particular client release is
buggy, we may not be able to support it at all.
<p/>

Content Release January 2013
<p/>
This release brings a huge amount of small fixes
and changes, including fixes of several spelling
and map errors, which were reported by players.
Thanks for that!
<p/>
There are a few new things nevertheless:
New characters won't have to start their
adventure in underpants anymore,
and Doug in Dimond's Cove discovered that the
lamps in his room wear off after a while.

A new peninsula has magically raised from the depths,
south of Hurnscald. A witch seems to be the source of
this strange phenomenon.
Why is she here, and what does she want?
<p/>
Further on the west, Lora Tay is willing to accept
new challenges to prove once more her skills.

Santa and his helpers have returned to Santa's residence
near Nivalis to prepare for Christmas.
Among the helpers, the preparations are moving smoothly
as they should.
The reinboos are excited this year since there will be a change
within their team!
But not everything is working out as planned.

Halloween has passed and several cities celebrated this event.
It seems the farmer Oscar just came back from a long journey
in one of these cities.
Probably he will have exciting things to tell.

The roadblock to the north east in Argaes was finally lifted
and parts of the road were reconstructed.
But there is still some work left until the connection to Port City is done.
In the Woods you can find a guy who lives alone, seeking seclusion.
Be careful not to disturb him. He is very vicious.
<p/>
The smith's apprentice Peter does good progress in mastering his
handcraft and learned some new techniques.

Agostine is well known for his magnificent winter clothes,
but he always dreamed of creating something truly exquisite,
something noble...
<p/>
An old veteran has set up camp in the caves below Hurnscald
after a life full of hardship and battle.
He may be old now, but he surely didn't lose his interest
in the art of combat!
