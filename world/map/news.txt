##0 Strange and ominous things are going on in Kaizei.
##0 Many people around Nivalis have noticed White and Blue Slimes
##0 around the area, which they have never seen before.
##0 Where do those come from? Are they dangerous?
##0 And why did they show up now?
##0 Rumors say that they originate from the snowy mountains
##0 north-west of Nivalis, where the famous Sage Nikolai
##0 has his residence.
##0
##0 Summer is coming near and it might be a good time
##0 to visit the beach with your Towel and relax a while.
##0 Oh, you don't have a Towel?
##0 Well, in that case you might find someone on the beach
##0 who can give you one!
 
##3 March 2012
##0
##0 Two announcements to make:
##0
##0 It seems Tulimshar is finally recovering from the impacts
##0 of the great earthquake.
##0 Although the eastern half of the city is still closed,
##0 it has become much more lively, with children playing between the houses,
##0 farmers going back to their fields, reports of increased trade activity.
##0
##0 Surely there are lots of tasks for a young adventurer!
##0
##0 Near Hurnscald a bunny showed up that looks like an older version
##0 of our well-known Easter Bunny.
##0 But what is he doing there? And where is Easter Bunny?
 
##3 2012-02-12 (ooh, what a nice date)
##0
##0 Three pieces of news today.
##0
##0 First, Mana 0.6.0 got released today. You can find it at
##3 http://manasource.org##0, or wait for your distribution.
##0
##0 Second, we will be completely dropping support for the old
##0 TMW 0.0.29.1 client soon - unless there is further reason
##0 for delay, in April 2012.
##0 
##0 Finally, there will be a purge of accounts that have not been
##0 used for over a year. This should help responsiveness
##0 when logging in and choosing a character.

##0 After all the activity in Nivalis due to the Christmas time,
##0 the townsfolk would like things to be quiet again.
##0 Unfortunately, some strange people have set up their camp 
##0 near the woods west of town.
##0 They came from their village high up in the northern snow mountains.
##0 What might have caused them to leave their hunting grounds
##0 and come down to Nivalis?
 
##3 Christmas 2011
 
##0 Christmas is coming near and Santa and his helpers are busy
##0 preparing everything for the celebration in Santa's house near Nivalis.
##0 But somehow... everything seems to go wrong.
##0 Bad luck? Or rather - malicious interference?
##0 It looks like someone could use your help.

##3 A Rule Correction on "No Botting"
 
##3 Previously, only activity while the user was
##3 away from the keyboard was a bannable offense.
##3 Now, any sort of automated following
##3 (especially, but not only, attack-following)
##3 is also covered.
 
##3 If you know any of the people who left this game
##3 due to the prevalence of bots that were previously
##3 tolerated, please tell them it's time to return.

##3 Halloween 2011
 
##0 Happy Halloween!
##0 This year the governments of Argaes and Tonori have decided to sponsor
##0 trick-or-treating across both continents.
##0 Have fun and don't make yourself sick by pigging out!
 
##0 Credits:

##0 Will Kill Monsters For Food?
 
##0 Recovery from the Great Earthquake is still
##0 very slow throughout the world.  The vast
##0 devastation still causes starvation and
##0 a lack of work.  A side effect of the Great
##0 Earthquake has been the increasing number of
##0 aggressive monsters and dooms long thought
##0 forgotten.
 
##0 To answer this problem Tulimshar
##0 has issued a call to be spread far and wide:
##0 "If you're hungry, if you need work, if you
##0 are in search of adventure, come to Tulimshar.
##0 Slaying monsters, liberating mines and
##0 defeating the night horrors that terrify even
##0 the most strong willed never paid so well!"
 
##0 Needless to say, many are answering this call.
##0 You may very well be one of them.
 
##0 Olana, the Innkeeper's Daughter, Returns to
##0 Hurnscald...But Where Are Her Daughters?
 
##0 Olana, who is staying in the West wing of the
##0 Hurnscald Inn, has been away to Tulimshar with
##0 her family since before the Earthquake.
##0 "The Earthquake may of happened a couple years
##0 ago, but everything is still messed up.
##0 I would've returned immediately, but I didn't
##0 want to put my family at risk until travel
##0 became a little safer."
 
##0 When asked about her daughters, Olana smiled
##0 "They love wandering the woods around here.
##0 Other than the occasional bandit group, things
##0 are usually much more peaceful around here than
##0 in Tulimshar.  I just hope they don't wander
##0 near these caves...I've heard many of them can
##0 be quite dangerous."

##3 June 2011
 
##0 A large shipment of gold coins was plundered
##0 by pirates.  The shipment was to be sent to
##0 Tulimshar as part of their effort to control
##0 inflation.  "They seemed to just come out of
##0 no where!  They took the shipment and my pet
##0 squirrel Chompers!"  Captain Zierock reported
##0 while in tears.
 
##0 It is believed the pirates divided the gold
##0 then went separate ways to spend their spoils.
##0 Ironically, these pirates were the target of
##0 monsters, who plundered them not just for
##0 their new found wealth, but also for their
##0 crunchy bones and sea salty flesh.
 
##0 On that note, be on the lookout for Green Slimes,
##0 which have grown hostile as they evolve to the
##0 harsh Tonori desert, making them a threat to
##0 travel and trade.  It is believed many of the
##0 pirates attempted to cross the Snake Desert,
##0 where they met the Green Slimes...and their
##0 end.
 
##0 In other news, Andra, a friend of Hinnak, has
##0 increased her agricultural knowledge and needs
##0 help keeping the soil around the farm fertile.
##0 Interested volunteers should speak with her
##0 about how to help.
 
##0 Last, but certainly not least, Agostine has
##0 returned to Nivalis.  While he enjoyed his
##0 time in Tulimshar, mingling with other artisans,
##0 he has missed his home in Kaizei.  "I made this
##0 fabulous sweater, but nobody wanted to wear it
##0 in this hot and smelly desert.  That is when I
##0 decided enough was enough.  Sweat is just gross."

##3 May 2011
 
##0 Many battle hardened warriors took some time
##0 during April and enjoyed helping the somewhat
##0 forgetful Easter Bunny make his baskets. The
##0 children surely must have enjoyed their sweets.
 
##0 The demi-god Golbenez has finally made good on
##0 his promise to open a 'place of leisure' in
##0 the form of an inn. Youngsters beware, since
##0 the entrance to this inn is near the old
##0 graveyard and could be dangerous.
 
##0 There have also been reports about a mysterious
##0 stranger roaming the beaches near Tulimshar.
##0 Be on the lookout if you are in the area.

##3 January 2011
 
##0 Reports of bandit raids to the west of
##0 Hurnscald has mobilized the town.  Those
##0 injured by these bandits may have a long stay
##0 ahead of them in Hurnscald's hospital.
 
##0 Shortly after Tulimshar loosened the tariff
##0 on travel, skill trainers have come to Mana.
##0 If one wants to improve themselves through
##0 acquiring skills, be on the lookout for these
##0 trainers.
 
##0 In other news, Taro is still missing, but
##0 Diryn, an agent of Tulimshar, has established
##0 a connection with the Kaizei area, making
##0 travel to Nivalis possible again.  He still
##0 assists the battle hardened travel distant
##0 locations just outside of Hurnscald.  Getting
##0 back can be done by finding Frozenbeard, a
##0 pioneer who is mapping a trade route to get
##0 to Nivalis by ship.
 
##0 Diryn's re-connection with Nivalis came none
##0 too soon.  Golbenez, a demi-god who demanded
##0 a half billion gold pieces for building some
##0 sort of leisure place, scrapped the idea and
##0 went for good old fashioned kidnapping to get
##0 whatever he wanted from the world of Mana.
##0 He kidnapped Santa Claus.  Fearful Santa may
##0  not gift the children of the world, wizards,
##0 warriors and archers rallied to pay the
##0 demi-god his demands.
 
##0 Shortly after Santa was freed, something more
##0 sinister has come to Kaizei.  The yeti.
##0 Sightings of this beast returns with stories
##0 of them.  Though aggressive, their behavior
##0 seems out of place.  They've never been known
##0 as cave dwellers nor to kidnap people.
 
##0 Last, but definitely not least, Dimond's Cove
##0 is observing "Burns' Supper" January 24-26th.
##0 Shanon is hosting the event, which he promises
##0 will be an excellent time for food, drink and
##0 poems.

##3 Countless candy-concerning complaints: council
##3 consequently considers citizen-composed cleanup crew
##3 Eighteenth of November 2010
 
##0 Recently, the ancient tradition of Hallowe'en
##0 was celebrated across Argaes, Tonori and other
##0 continents. Estimated tons of sweets were given
##0 out to happy trick-or-treaters, and as with
##0 most other years a lot of this vast total was
##0 dropped on the night. Even a week and a half
##0 after Hallowe'en, many kilograms of sweets
##0 still litter our pleasant woodlands.
 
##0 After dozens of letters regarding the situation,
##0 the Hurnscald Council has said that the best
##0 solution would be to organise a team of
##0 volunteers to work on collecting dropped sweets
##0 and disposing of them - but it has yet to
##0 organise any such thing.
 
##0 In the meantime, why not do your bit and collect
##0 some sweets for yourself? If you don't mind them
##0 being a bit old, you could be able to make the
##0 biggest Hallowe'en haul in history.
 
##0 Additionally, we've been getting some reports of
##0 a rather creepy skeleton hanging around the
##0 woodland. He doesn't appear to be aggressive,
##0 but he chatters unintelligibly at passers-by.
 
 
##3 Rollback
##0 2010-11-17
##0
##0 Everything should now be running from a
##0 complete save state (including storage, banks,
##0 parties etc) that is even two days more recent
##0 than what we were temporarilyrunning on before.
##0 All credit to Platyna for speedy recovery and
##0 even more recent backups. :)
##0
##3 Server outage
##0 2010-11-16
##0
##0 Things running on the four day old backups,
##0 restricted to account save info and character
##0 save info for now while we try to get other
##0 databases working.
##0
##0 This means no party data or storage data for
##0 now, we'll try to recover that along with
##0 everything else, as we should be able to get
##0 a full saved state from within the past week.
##0
##0 The current setup is more to have something
##0 partially up, and so that people know what's
##0 going on while we try to fix things; any
##0 in-game progress made right now##1will not
##0 persist.
##0
##3 Server outage
##0 2010-11-16
##0
##0 Okay, apparently even that won't work right now.
##0 Servers will remain##3offline##0 until we figure out
##0 what we can do.
##0
##3 Server outage
##0 2010-11-16
##0
##0 We've just had a serious server crash, and the
##0 databases seem to have been affected here. We're
##0 currently running on some four-day old backups;
##0 whether this will be a temporary measure or
##0 whether newer ones are usable is yet to be
##0 determined.
##0
##0 Please note that the current state may only
##0 be##3temporary##0, and that if usable newer backups
##0 are found within the next 24 hours, those will
##0 be used instead, and any character progress
##0 made may be lost. If no usable backups are
##0 found during this time, the four-day rollback
##0 will have to be permanent.
##0
##0 More news updates will follow once we've
##0 investigated further; we're doing what we can...

##3 Testing server.
##3 2010-09-25
##0
##0 As you've probably noticed, we've set up a
##0 testing server accessible from the same
##0 login-server as usual.
##0
##0 All characters have been copied, so you
##0 should have all levels, money, equipment etc
##0 as normal.
##0
##0 Changes are far from complete, but it should be
##0 a good start, and the fundamentals should be
##0 there.
##0
##0 The server will be used for balance efforts;
##0 a number of combat mechanics have been reworked.
##0
##0 Note that while game mechanics have changed, no
##0 new content has been added to this server, so
##0 you won't have to worry about spoilers.
##0
##0 Experiment, and remember to give feedback!
##0 Contact us using either:
##0 The forums at##1forums.themanaworld.org##0,
##0 Our irc server, at##1irc.themanaworld.org##0.

##0 Throughout Argaes, new trade regulations from
##0 Tulimshar have concentrated wealth and power
##0 inside Tonori's largest city.  The primary
##0 resource of Argaes, iron ore, now must be
##0 refined into ingots within Tulimshar's
##0 imperial capital.
##0
##0 Argaes miners, in search of new iron deposits,
##0 have discovered a hostile mine north west of
##0 the woodland town of Hurnscald.  More details
##0 are coming in about this mine.
##0
##3 Tulimshar's Power Expands
##3 2010-08-18
##0 The impact of the Great Earthquake has brought
##0 a rising evil to the land.  After much debate
##0 Tulimshar's Wizard Council has begun to expand
##0 its influence in the world to meet the new
##0 challenges presented.
##0
##0 While still slow to act, Tulimshar has begun
##0 monitoring the changing monster threat in the
##0 sandstorm and sent agents into Argaes.  The
##0 landbridge that long united Argaes with Tonori
##0 has fallen into the sea, prompting Tulimshar's
##0 merchants to charge a hefty fee for trade and
##0 travel between the two continents.
##0
##0 Something sinister has happened to Taro, Nivalis
##0 and the magical connection Kaizei had with
##0 Argaes.  Some speculate it has something to do
##0 with the evil while others think Nivalis and the
##0 Sages of Kaizei want to isolate themselves from
##0 Tulimshar's influence.  Either way, all portals
##0 to Kaizei have been closed.
##0
##3 The Candor Challenge
##3 2010-08-18
##0
##0 In the lost island of Candor, a skeletal figure
##0 stands, awaiting for fresh blood to wander right
##0 in and pay him for the privilege of being killed
##0 in nasty ways. How long are you and your friends
##0 able to survive in the cave of horrors?
##0
##0 In other news, you may also have run into an
##0 evil obelisk, trader of strange items, a water
##0 pump, a flood and some new insect life recently!
##0
##3 The End is not nigh
##3 2010-06-09
 
##0 Content and technical development is currently
##0 split between the new server and the current
##0 tmwAthena server. Once the new sever is ready
##0 to be opened for public, you will be able to
##0 create a new character there or keep playing
##0 your old character on tmwAthena - or both!
##0 The tmwAthena server will keep running as
##0 long as there are people who want to play there.
