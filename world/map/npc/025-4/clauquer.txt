    "Of course not.", -;
  next;
  mes "[Clauquer]";
  mes "\"I can see that you really want to save the little girl. She is trapped in a place inside one of these caves, protected by a magic barrier created by a fey spirit. To save her, you have to annulate the energy sources of this barrier. They are located in 10 different spots, each one in a different cave.\"";
  next;
  menu
    "But how can I annulate this barrier?", -;
  mes "\"It is simple, you just have to place a root on the exact center of the energy source. Once you do this, its entire power will transmute into some terrible earth monsters. If you defeat them, this source of energy will be close to nothing and the barrier will be weaker.\"";
  next;
  mes "\"If my observations are correct, the girl is trapped in a cave protected by a barrier fed by 9 different power sources. And inside this cave, there is another barrier, fed by a single, but very strong, power source. The girl is inside that cave, protected by that strong barrier.\"";
  next;
  mes "\"Be prepared before you enter one of those caves, because once you put the root in the power source, you won't be able to get out. Also, remember that you can't stay in those caves for a long time, because of the foul air.\"";

  mes "[Clauquer]";

  next;
  mes "\"The old tales of Hurnscald say this spirit always exchanges his offspring with beautiful and smart human children, to use them as servants. And his offspring usually forget about their own origin, growing up in a human family. But they are usually 'people' with really bad tempers, the kind of people who do terrible things in this world...\"";
  next;
  mes "However, the girl you are looking for is mentally too strong, and the spirit is having problems creating a changeling identical to her. So it locked her in one of those terrible caves, trying to scare the poor girl and make his task easier.\"";
  next;
  mes "\"Oh, and if you really plan to rescue the girl in the cave, I advise you to use potions for every single battle. I'm thinking of Concentration and Iron Potions. You might want to take some food with you too, you might be hungry in battle. I would personally take some water, I'm always thirsty. Don't be afraid to take too much of each, the battles take time to end.\"";
